    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "Data wrangling steps include Gathering of data, assessing of the data and Cleaning of the data.\n",
    "#### 1. Gather \n",
    "First of all, the WeRateDogs Twitter archive data (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv) was directly downloaded and then imported into the workspace using the pd.read_csv command.\n",
    "The Requests library was then to download the tweet image prediction (image_predictions.tsv) using requests.get(url) command.\n",
    "The last part of the data gathering step was using the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API (tweet_json.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.\tAssess\n",
    "Nine (9) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issue were detected and documented. They are as follows:\n",
    "##### Quality Issues\n",
    "1.\tThere are duplicate images for some entries.\n",
    "2.\tSome column names are confusing as they do not give much information about the content.\n",
    "3.\tThere is more than one classification for some dogs.\n",
    "4.\tSome dogs have no classification.\n",
    "5.\tThe image prediction dataset has 2075 entries as compared to twitter archive's 2356 entries.\n",
    "6.\tThere are some missing values.\n",
    "7.\tThe number of data entries in the twitter API dataset differs from the other two datasets.\n",
    "8.\tThere are some wrong dog names. Eg. a dog being called 'a'\n",
    "9.\tTimestamp has wrong datatype that is object instead of date.\n",
    "##### Tidiness Issues\n",
    "1.\tAll the datasets should be merged.\n",
    "2.\tThe columns that classify dogs should be added together for easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.\tClean \n",
    "Some of the issues documented were accessed. These issues are as follows:\n",
    "1.\tThere is more than one classification for some dogs.\n",
    "2.\tTimestamp has wrong datatype that is object instead of date.\n",
    "3.\tThere are duplicate images for some entries.\n",
    "4.\tThere are some missing values.\n",
    "5.\tSome columns are not necessary\n",
    "6.\tNew column needed.\n",
    "7.\tSome column names are confusing as they do not give much information about the content.\n",
    "8.\tReordering column names.\n"
